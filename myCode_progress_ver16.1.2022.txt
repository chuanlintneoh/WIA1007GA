In contrast, taking the amount of food intake as a constant, the obesity trend for height ranged between 1.61 metres and 1.65 metres can be assumed to be caused by shorter individuals which require fewer calories than taller individuals, just by the nature of the fact that they are smaller. Therefore, we can conclude that decreasing height will increase the risk of obesity.

At the weight of higher range, there is only left with obesity which other 3 types of obesity have 0 frequency. This justified the formula of calculating BMI (weight (in kg)/ height^2 (in m^2)) at which weight is directly proportional to BMI. As BMI increases, the type of obesity changes from underweight, normal to overweight and lastly obesity."
